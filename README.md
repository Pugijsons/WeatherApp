# WeatherApp
A weather data fetching application with in-built geolocation using third party services.

# Features

* Retrieves the closest available weather data.
* Saves them to a database and a in-memory storage.
* Allows for retrieval of already queried data from in-memory storage if the query is made within an hour of the first one.
